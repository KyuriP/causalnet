\title{Detect Unique Feedback Loops in a Directed Network}
\usage{
detect_feedback_loops(adj_matrix, include_self_loops = FALSE, use_names = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix}{Square directed adjacency (non-zero = edge).}

\item{include_self_loops}{Logical; include 1-node self-loops (default FALSE).}

\item{use_names}{Logical; return node names if available (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
List of unique loops, each as a sorted vector (names if available, else indices).
}
\description{
Detects all directed cycles (including 2-node loops) and returns each as a
unique set of nodes (ignores order and entry point).
}
