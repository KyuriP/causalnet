\title{Detect Feedback Loops (Cycles) in a Directed Network}
\usage{
detect_feedback_loops(adj_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix}{A square adjacency matrix representing a directed network.
Non-zero entries indicate directed edges.}
}
\value{
A list of feedback loops. Each loop is a vector of node indices (1-based).
Each loop appears only once in canonical order.
}
\description{
This function finds all feedback loops (i.e., directed cycles) in a directed adjacency matrix.
It includes both multi-node and 2-node bidirectional cycles, while avoiding duplicate reporting
of the same logical loop in different orders.
}
\examples{
adj <- matrix(0, 3, 3)
adj[1, 2] <- 1
adj[2, 3] <- 1
adj[3, 1] <- 1  # Forms a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
detect_feedback_loops(adj)
