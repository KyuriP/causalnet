\title{Generate All Directed Networks Consistent with Constraints}
\usage{
generate_directed_networks(
  adj_matrix,
  allow_bidirectional = TRUE,
  fixed_edges = NULL,
  max_networks = Inf,
  show_progress = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix}{Symmetric binary (0/1) adjacency matrix (undirected skeleton).}

\item{allow_bidirectional}{Logical. Allow bidirectional A↔B edges (default = TRUE).}

\item{fixed_edges}{Matrix of same size as adj_matrix. Use:
\itemize{
\item 1: force edge from A to B (A → B),
\item 2: force bidirectional (A ↔ B),
\item NA or 0: unconstrained,
\item -1: forbid edge from A to B.
}}

\item{max_networks}{Optional. Maximum number of networks to return (default = Inf).
Useful to prevent memory overload when constraints are loose and
the number of valid networks becomes extremely large.
Set this to a smaller number (e.g., 1000) to explore a random subset
or for quick diagnostics.}

\item{show_progress}{Logical. Show a text progress bar (default = interactive()).}
}
\value{
List of unique directed adjacency matrices with names preserved.
}
\description{
Given an undirected adjacency matrix, this function generates all possible
directed networks consistent with its skeleton and any user-specified
direction constraints. Optionally includes bidirectional edges and
(optionally) shows a progress bar.
